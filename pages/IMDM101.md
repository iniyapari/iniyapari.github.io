This artwork is based off one of the imagined worlds by Italo Calvino 
from his book &quot;Imaginary Cities&quot; This city in particular hangs 
between two cliffs that are hanging the civilization through spiderwebs. 
This artwork made me realize how fascinating Immersive Media was, and also 
how enriching and necessary it is to work in a team.
